<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![App Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Currently the process of matchmaking in the amateur football is primitive and cumbersome, It takes hours of back and forth on phone calls to organise a team and you are limited with your own social circle.

The aim of our App is to make football matches easier to organize and bring everyone closer.

With this app:

 - you are able to start a team, find your friends and invite them to join you.
 - when your team is still incomplete, you can find others from your area who are willing to join.
 - when all your friends are busy, you can allow teams to invite you in their game.

### Built With

In the planning phase, we wanted to in the future to have the option of releasing the app and make it a start-up, so to have fast, broad reach, we chose to go with cross-platform technologies and the scalability of cloud services.
* [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
